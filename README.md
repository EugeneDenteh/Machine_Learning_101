## Introduction

Machine learning is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field with a broad range of applications. In this course, we will focus on the fundamental libraries that are commonly used in data preprocessing, manipulation, and machine learning tasks. These libraries are essential for anyone getting started in the field.

## Course Overview

- **Pandas**: Pandas is a versatile data manipulation library. It provides data structures and functions for working with structured data, making it a powerful tool for data cleaning and analysis.

- **NumPy**: NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It offers support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and a wide range of mathematical functions.

- **scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn is a comprehensive library for machine learning. It includes various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more. You'll learn how to use it for building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with fundamental data concepts (e.g., variables, data types, and basic data structures).

## Course Content

This course is divided into the following sections:

1. **Pandas Basics**: An introduction to Pandas, covering data structures like DataFrames and Series, data manipulation, and basic data analysis.

2. **NumPy Essentials**: A dive into NumPy, including arrays, operations, and mathematical functions for numerical computing.

3. **Introduction to scikit-learn**: An overview of scikit-learn, exploring its capabilities and how to use it for machine learning tasks.
